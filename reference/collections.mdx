A `Collection` in R2R is a logical grouping mechanism that enables organization and access control for documents and their associated chunks. Collections serve as a fundamental unit for managing permissions, sharing content, and organizing related documents across users and teams.

Collections in R2R provide:

* Organizational structure for documents
* Access control and permissions management
* Group-based content sharing
* Document categorization and management
* User collaboration capabilities

A in R2R is a knowledge `graph` that is associated with a specific. Each Graph contains:

* **Entities**: Extracted information nodes from documents (e.g., people, places, concepts)
* **Relationships**: Connections between entities defining how they relate
* **Communities**: LLM generated descriptions of groupings of related entities found from Leiden clustering.
* **Document Mappings**: Tracking which documents have contributed to the graph

Key features of Graphs in R2R:

1. **Git-like Model**

   * Each Collection has an associated Graph that can diverge independently
   * The pull operation syncs document knowledge into the graph
   * Changes can be experimental without affecting the base Collection and underlying documents

2. **Knowledge Organization**

   * Automatic entity and relationship extraction from documents
   * Community detection for hierarchical knowledge organization
   * Support for manual creation and editing of entities, relationships and communities
   * Rich metadata and property management

3. **Access Control**

   * Graph operations are tied to Collection permissions
   * Superuser privileges required for certain operations like community building
   * Document-level access checks when pulling content

## Core Operations

| Method                          | Endpoint                                                            | Description               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| GET                             | [/graphs/](/reference/get-graph-overview)                                | Get graph overview        |
| POST                            | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/pull](/reference/pull-and-rebuild-graph)      | Sync documents with graph |
| POST                            | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/](/reference/get-graph-data-for-a-collection) | Get graph details         |

## Entity Management

| Method | Endpoint                                                                            | Description                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| GET    | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/entities](/reference/list-graph-entities)                     | List entities (/[r2r-docs.sciphi.ai]/[1]) |
| POST   | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/entities](/reference/add-new-entities)                        | Create entity                             |
| GET    | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/entities/\{entity_id}](/reference/get-single-entity-details) | Get entity details                        |

Similar CRUD endpoints exist by mapping `/entities` above to for relationships (`/relationships`) and communities (`/communities`).

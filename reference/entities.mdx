### Entity management endpoints

Entities are basic building blocks of a graph. They can be automatically extracted from a document and then added to a graph.

To manage entities extracted from a document, you can use the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                                                  | Description                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | [/documents/\{id}/entities](/reference/get-extracted-entities) | List *Entities* identified within a document. |

Once entities are added to a graph by a POST to “/graphs/\{id}/\{object_type}” endpoint, you can manage them using the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                                                                            | Description                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| GET    | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/entities](/reference/list-graph-entities)                     | List entities (/[r2r-docs.sciphi.ai]/[1]) |
| POST   | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/entities](/reference/add-new-entities)                        | Create entity                             |
| GET    | [/graphs/\{collection_id}/entities/\{entity_id}](/reference/get-single-entity-details) | Get entity details                        |

## What Is RAG on R2R?

* **Retrieval + Generation Workflow:** RAG operates in two phases:

  * **Retrieve** relevant document chunks via semantic search or knowledge graph lookup.
  * **Generate** coherent and contextually accurate responses using those retrieved chunks and your customized prompts.

* **Why It Matters:** By tapping into real, structured, or unstructured content, RAG systems produce answers grounded in facts, avoiding hallucinations and improving trustworthiness.

## Core Components

| Component              | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documents & Chunks** | Ingested files or text are segmented into **Chunks**—the basis for retrieval.                     |
| **Indices**            | Vector indices enable fast similarity search over chunk embeddings.                               |
| **Graphs**             | Knowledge graph extracts relationships and entities, enabling intelligent navigation of concepts. |
| **Prompts**            | Prompt templates shape the generation step, with type-safe inputs and version control.            |
| **System Endpoints**   | Provide health checks, diagnostics, and monitoring for your RAG pipeline.                         |

## Getting Started

To get started with the R2R API, you’ll need to:

* [Install R2R](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R) in your environment
* Run the server with `python -m r2r.serve`, or customize your FastAPI for production settings.

For detailed installation and setup instructions, please refer to R2R [Installation Guide](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/self-hosting/installation/overview).

## Authentication

### API keys

IO Intelligence APIs authenticate requests using API keys. You can [generate API keys from your user](https://ai.io.net/ai/api-keys) account:

<Warning>
Always treat your API key as a secret! Do not share it or expose it in client-side code (e.g., browsers or mobile apps). Instead, store it securely in an environment variable or a key management service on your backend server.
</Warning>

Include the API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header for all API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer \$IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY
```

## Examples for RAG Workflows

### Step 1: Search for relevant chunks (Retrieval)

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  curl -X POST https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/api/r2r/v3/retrieval/search /
    -H "Authorization: Bearer \$IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY" /
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" /
    -d '{
      "query": "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?",
      "top_k": 5
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Generate a response using RAG

Assuming you’ve retrieved relevant chunks and want to pass them as context:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  curl -X POST https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/api/r2r/v3/rag/generate /
    -H "Authorization: Bearer \$IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY" /
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" /
    -d '{
      "prompt_name": "default_rag",
      "inputs": {
        "query": "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?",
        "context": "Chunk 1 text/nChunk 2 text/nChunk 3 text" //it's just example chunk text
      }
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Token Quotas & Usage

Each account has daily usage limits based on model and request volume. Check the [IO Intelligence API Quotas](/reference/get-started-with-io-intelligence-api#quotas) for up-to-date information.

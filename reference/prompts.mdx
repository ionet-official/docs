A `Prompt` in R2R represents a templated instruction or query pattern that can be reused across the system. Prompts are managed by superusers and provide a consistent way to structure interactions with language models and other AI components.

Prompts in R2R provide:

* Templated instruction management
* Type-safe input handling
* Centralized prompt governance
* Dynamic prompt generation
* Version control for prompts

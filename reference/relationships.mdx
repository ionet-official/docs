## Relationship management endpoints

Relationships are basic building blocks of a graph. They can be automatically extracted from a document and then added to a graph.

To manage relationships extracted from a document, you can use the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                                                 | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | [/documents/\{id}/relationship](/reference/get-relationships) | List *Relationships* identified within a document. |

Once entities are added to a graph using the “/graphs/\{id}/\{object_type}/add” endpoint, you can manage them using the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                                                      | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GET    | [/graphs/\{id}/relationships](/reference/get-graph-relationships)  | Get relationships for a graph  |
| GET    | [/graphs/\{id}/relationships/\{id}](/reference/get-relationship-details) | Get a relationship for a graph |

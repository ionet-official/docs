A `Conversation` in R2R represents a threaded exchange of messages that can branch into multiple paths. Conversations provide a structured way to maintain dialogue history, support branching discussions, and manage message flows.

Conversations in R2R provide:

* Threaded message management
* Message editing with history preservation
* Metadata attachment capabilities
* Conversational context maintenance

### Worker Details

The **Device View** page provides a comprehensive overview of the device's details. io.net presents real-time data on transmitted traffic, connection status, and uptime history.

Users can monitor the status of all active services on the device and activate additional ones by purchasing io.coins. By default, these services are automatically linked to the worker:

* IO Version Control
* IO Monitor
* Ray.io

Equally important is the device's current/past tasks and its complete notification history, conveniently accessible through the corresponding tabs after 'Services' tab.

The worker detail page displays the following information:

* List of Jobs and status
* Uptime Graph
* Type of GPU/CPU
* Uptime Percentage
* Remaining Compute Hours
* Daily block Rewards Earnings
* Connectivity Tier
* Notifications

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Q: My graphics card is sufficient, but my internet or RAM is not enough. Can I still receive airdrop rewards?">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q: I have followed all the steps correctly, but my Worker is not visible on the website. What should I do?">
If you've [completed all the steps](/docs/install-on-macos) in the guide and your Worker is still not visible, you can create a ticket in the #support-tickets channel on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ionetofficial) server for assistance.

<Accordion title="Q: Should I keep my computer on 24/7?">
For maximum airdrop rewards and system stability, it's recommended to keep your computer running continuously. You can "pause" the system in emergencies, but extended periods of downtime may result in suspension.

<Accordion title="Q: Can I participate using a VPS?">
It is not recommended due to both the cost and potential issues it may cause.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q: My Worker status shows 'Idle' - is this a problem?">

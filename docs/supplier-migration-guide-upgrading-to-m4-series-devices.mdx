title: "Supplier Migration Guide: Upgrading to M4 Series Devices"
description: "April 2025"
---

Suppliers on io.net can now seamlessly upgrade their existing inventory of **M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra** devices to the cutting-edge **M4 series.** This transition ensures enhanced performance, improved efficiency, and continued eligibility for earnings on the io.net platform.

<Warning>
**Important Pre-Migration Requirement**:

  Before initiating the migration, ensure your current M2 worker has been actively earning Block Rewards for at least the last 3 continuous hours (i.e., passing PoW tests and contributing work).

  If this condition is not met, the new M4 device will be automatically blocked during the migration process.
</Warning>

### Important Migration Dates:

* **Migration Start:** UTC 09:00 AM on April 3rd, 2025
* **End of Support for M2 Devices:** UTC 23:59:59 on April 21st, 2025
* **Migration Window Closes:** UTC 23:59:59 on April 21st, 2025

<Info>
Only currently connected devices with full stake are eligible for migration.

### M4 Series Device Options

| Device | Earning Multiplier | Ray Cluster Pricing | Staking Requirement |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| M4     | 0.5x               | $0.10/hour          | \$IO 200             |
| M4 Pro | 0.75x              | $0.13/hour          | \$IO 200             |
| M4 Max | 1x                 | $0.15/hour          | \$IO 200             |

### Migration Process:

##### Step 1: Disconnect Your M2 Device

Before migrating, ensure your **M2 Pro, M2 Max, or M2 Ultra** device is **disconnected** from the io.net network.

##### Step 2: Execute the Migration Command

Once your M2 device is disconnected, run the following command on your new **M4, M4 Pro, or M4** Max device:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl curl
  ./io_net_launch_binary_mac --device_id={same device id} --user_id={same user_id} 
  --operating_system="macOS" --usegpus=false --device_name="{same device name}"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

##### Step 3: Ensure Proper Configuration

Your new **M4 series** device should be **correctly configured** with a **stable internet connection** to avoid loss of **Block Rewards** during migration.

### Benefits of Migration:

When migrating to the M4 series, your new device will:

* **Retain** **the same device_id**
* **Retain the same \$IO staked** (M2 Pro/Max staking requirements match M4/M4 Pro/M4 Max)
* **For M2 Ultra migrations**: The excess 50 \$IO (beyond the minimum staking requirement) will be withdrawable without a cooldown period after approximately 24-48 hours post-migration./*/*

### Additional Update:

This migration ensures suppliers remain operational on io.net while benefiting from the **next-generation M4 series devices**. We appreciate your continued support as we drive decentralized computing forward.

**Thank you for your continued partnership and support as we move towards a more innovative future together.**

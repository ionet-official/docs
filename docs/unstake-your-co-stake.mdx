## Unstaking

You can cancel a stake at any time. If a co-staker unstakes first, an additional **7-day wait period** is added to the **14-day cooldown**, making the stake unavailable for **21 days**.

#### Partial Unstaking of Overflow (Solo Stakers)

Solo stakers can also partially unstake their excess (overflow) amount without deactivating the worker.

* **Overflow** is calculated as: `(Your Stake + Co-stake) â€“ Minimum Stake Requirement`

* You can withdraw this overflow at any time by:

  * Using the **Withdraw Overflow** button (if visible), or
  * Selecting **Unstake** and entering an amount equal to or less than the overflow.

<Warning>
If you enter more than the overflow amount, the system will treat it as a full unstake and deactivate the device.
</Warning>

#### Important Notes

* Unstaking may be **blocked** if:

  * The device is currently **rented in a cluster**
  * The offer is **open** and unstaking would reduce the total stake below the required minimum

There is **no penalty** or impact on the device status when withdrawing only the overflow amount.

## Introduction
IO Cloud enables the deployment and management of on-demand, decentralized GPU clusters, giving users access to powerful GPU resources without significant hardware investments or the complexity of managing infrastructure. IO Cloud democratizes GPU access by leveraging a decentralized model, providing machine learning engineers and developers with the same seamless experience as traditional cloud providers.

The platform utilizes a distributed network of nodes, IO workers, to offer flexible, scalable compute resources. IO Cloud clusters are self-healing, fully meshed GPU systems that ensure high availability and fault tolerance. With IO Cloud, you can tap into a decentralized network of GPUs and CPUs capable of running Python-based machine learning workloads. It is ideal for AI projects requiring distributed compute. The platform is natively built on the Ray framework, the same distributed computing technology used by OpenAI to train models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 across hundreds of thousands of servers.

description: "In the world of decentralized networks, staking is a crucial way to secure blockchain systems and reward participants. Collaborative Staking (Co-Staking) takes this idea further by allowing third parties to participate in staking on devices they don't own, earning a share of the block rewards. This makes staking more accessible and encourages a more inclusive and cooperative network."

On our platform, **Co-Staking** allows users to contribute to staking on someone else’s device. This creates a partnership where both the device owner and the co-staker benefit. However, it’s important to remember that if a device doesn't meet the platform’s requirements, it could be penalized (a process called **slashing**), which may reduce both rewards and the original staked amount.

This guide will walk you through how to find staking opportunities, manage your co-staked devices, and track your rewards. Whether you're experienced with staking or just getting started, we’ll provide the tools and knowledge you need to navigate the Co-Staking system with confidence.

<Info>
To ensure that more users can benefit from co-staking offers, we have set a claim cap of up to two offers per IO account.

## FAQs

We've compiled answers to frequently asked questions about co-staking on io.net, including troubleshooting tips and guidelines to help users navigate the platform.

#### Getting Started with Co-Staking

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Q: Why is the 'Create Co-Staking Offer' button greyed out for my device?">

If you're a device owner and the **"Create Co-Staking Offer"** button is greyed out, it likely means your device hasn’t met the minimum self-staking requirement. io.net requires you to stake a certain amount of **$IO tokens** on the device before inviting co-stakers. In most cases, you must stake **at least 50%** of the total required amount before creating an offer.

Ensure that:

* Your device is fully set up and active on the network.
* You have met the minimum staking requirement.

Co-staking is only available for operational devices.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q. Can a person co-stake on multiple devices?">

**Yes**, co-stakers can participate in multiple devices simultaneously. However, you can **only claim offers from two devices at any given time**. This ensures fair distribution and prevents one person from monopolizing multiple co-staking opportunities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q. Can I co-stake on my own device?">

**No**, device owners **cannot co-stake on their own devices**. This rule is in place to prevent users from bypassing staking requirements, such as the **minimum self-staking threshold**. Co-staking is designed to foster collaboration between independent parties.

<Info>
Unstaking involves a 7-day waiting period followed by a 14-day cooldown period. Funds cannot be used during the cooldown, and rewards are paused during this time.
</Info>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Co-Staking Terms & Rules

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Q. How many co-stakers can a device have?">

Each device can have **only one co-staker per offer.** Co-staking agreements follow a **one-to-one structure**:

* **1 device owner → 1 co-staker**

If a device owner needs more than one co-staker, they must create multiple offers or reduce their own stake. **Co-stakers can participate in up to two devices at the same time.**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q. Are the identities of co-stakers or device owners visible?">

No, identities are **anonymized** within the marketplace. While users can view **device specifications and staking terms**, personal details of device owners or co-stakers are not disclosed.

However, **wallet addresses are visible on the blockchain**, but they do not directly reveal the identity of the parties involved.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q. Can I change the terms of a co-staking agreement after it has been accepted?">

**No**, once a co-staking offer is accepted, its terms are **locked in via a smart contract**. You **cannot modify** the stake amount, reward split, or other conditions after activation.

If changes are needed, you must:

1. **Cancel or close** the existing offer.
2. **Create a new** offer with the updated terms.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Withdrawing & Unstaking

<Accordion title="Q. How do I unstake and withdraw funds from co-staking?">

To withdraw your staked funds:

1. Click "**Unstake**" - this initiates a **7-day waiting period** where your tokens stop earning rewards.
2. After the waiting period, your stake enters a **14-day cooldown period**.
3. Once the cooldown ends, your tokens will be available for withdrawal.
</Accordion>

#### Risks & Performance Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Q. What if the device I co-staked on performs poorly or goes offline?">

io.net has a **slashing mechanism** that penalizes underperforming devices. If a device frequently goes offline or fails to meet performance requirements, **both the device owner's and co-staker's stake may be slashed**.

<Info>
Slashing means forfeiting part of the staked amount as a penalty.
</Info>

To minimize risk, always **select reliable devices** before co-staking.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q. How does co-staking compare to traditional staking?">

Unlike traditional staking, where tokens are delegated to validators, **co-staking on io.net directly stakes tokens onto a specific device.**

Key differences:

* Co-stakers share the risk of slashing.
* Rewards and conditions are set in a **smart contract.**
* It promotes a **collaborative staking model** rather than simple delegation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Troubleshooting & Support

<Accordion title="Q. What should I do if I experience an issue not covered in the FAQs?">

If you encounter a problem, such as:

* A **transaction error**
* A **device not appearing in the marketplace**
* **Co-staking issues**

Try the following:

* Ensure you’re using the **official io.net platform**.
* Verify that your **wallet is properly connected**.
* **Clear your browser cache** or try a **different browser**.

If the issue persists, reach out to **io.net support** through:

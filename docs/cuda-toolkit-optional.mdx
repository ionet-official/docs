### What is CUDA?

The CUDA Toolkit is like a toolbox for programmers who want to make their software run faster using NVIDIA graphics cards. It has everything they need, like tools and instructions, to write code that takes advantage of the graphics card's power for tasks like math calculations, simulations, and artificial intelligence. Here are a few steps to install the CUDA Toolkit:

### 1. Go to [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) Download Page

Choose either the Windows or Linux operating system to access additional settings.

### 2. Provide Additional Information

For Windows, you need to choose your architecture, which is usually x86_64 for 64-bit systems.

Follow these steps to resolve the error:

1. When reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit, opt for **Custom (Advanced)** installation.

       className="mx-auto"
       style={{ width:"85%" }}
     />
   </Frame>
2. After selecting the custom installation option, expand the **CUDA** section and uncheck the option for **Nsight Compute** to exclude it from the installation. This step ensures that only the necessary components are installed, reducing the likelihood of errors.

3. Proceed with the installation process.

### 6. Verify the Installation Process

After the installation, open Windows Terminal and enter the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```Text Terminal Command
nvcc --version
```

</CodeGroup>

You should receive a similar response:

```

```

### That’s It. You Have the Cuda Toolkit Installed and Ready

Now that CUDA Toolkit has been successfully installed and is running, you can proceed with [setting up the Worker](/docs/install-on-windows)

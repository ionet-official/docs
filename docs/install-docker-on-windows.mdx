### What is Docker?

Let's take a quick look at what **Docker** is? Imagine Docker as a magic box where you put your software and everything it needs to run. This box can be easily carried to any computer, and when you open it, your software works just the way you packed it, without needing anything extra from that computer. Here are a few steps to install Docker:

  **Network Capability Issue on Docker Desktop for Windows**

  We are currently investigating a network performance issue with Docker Desktop on Windows. This might be due to Docker's overhead, and we are exploring potential fixes.

  **Recommendation**: <br/>If you experience this issue, we recommend switching to Linux as a temporary workaround.

  Thank you for your understanding and patience.

### First, verify that Virtualization is Enabled on your Computer.

To verify if virtualization is enabled, open **Task Manager** by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del. Select "**Performance**" and then click on the "**CPU**" tab to view the information in the bottom right corner, as shown in the image below:

</Frame>

<Warning>
If it's not enabled, follow these steps:
</Warning>

1. To enable virtualization technology in your BIOS or UEFI settings, you need to access your computer's BIOS or UEFI configuration menu during the boot process. The specific steps can vary depending on your computer's manufacturer and model, but here are the general steps to enable virtualization.
2. Install WSL 2 by opening the PowerShell as an Administrator. To do this, search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-click on "Windows PowerShell," and select "Run as administrator."
3. Run the following command to enable the WSL feature in **Windows 10/11** in Terminal:
   <CodeGroup>
     ```Text Terminal Command
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
4. Then **Enable** the Virtual Machine Platform Feature while still in the same PowerShell window by running the following command:
   <CodeGroup>
     ```Text Terminal Command
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
     ```
   </CodeGroup>
5. Then set WSL 2 as the Default Version (you might be required to restart your machine sometimes):
   <CodeGroup>
     ```Text Terminal Command
     wsl --set-default-version 2
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

### 1. Download Docker

Go to the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and click on "**Download for Windows**." Downloading the Docker file may take some time. Please be patient.

### 2. Run the Installation Process

The installation starts when you open the file. Follow the prompts. When the installation process is completed, you need to **restart your computer.** Just click the "**Close and Restart**" button on the last step of the Docker wizard:

### 3. Configure WSL2  to Integrate with Docker Settings

Open the Docker settings. In the Resources section, choose <Tooltip tip="WSL 2 – It's a feature in Windows that lets you run a full Linux system on your computer without needing to set up a separate machine or use complex software. It provides a seamless way to use Linux tools and applications alongside your regular Windows programs, making it easier for developers and tech enthusiasts to work with both systems at the same time.">WSL 2</Tooltip> Integration and check the box for <Tooltip tip="WSL 2 – It's a feature in Windows that lets you run a full Linux system on your computer without needing to set up a separate machine or use complex software.

Copy and paste the following line into Terminal.

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text Terminal Command
  docker --version
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The result will be the current version of Docker.

```
Docker version 24.0.6, build ed223bc
```

## Testing AI Model

Before using any of our AI models in your project, you can perform real-time testing directly from the dashboard. This allows you to evaluate the model’s performance and ensure it meets your requirements.

### How to Test an AI Model

1. **Select a Model:**

   * Navigate to the **AI Models** dashboard.

   * Select the model you want to test by clicking on it.

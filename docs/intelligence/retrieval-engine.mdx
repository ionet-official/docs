description: "The Retrieval Engine is a powerful tool within the io.net ecosystem that enhances your AI applications with capabilities like document ingestion, intelligent file management, agentic reasoning, and conversational question answering."
---

Retrieval Engine allows your AI to **read, view**, and **listen** to various types of content — learning from them in real-time. Once your files are ingested, Retrieval Engine combines the insights and context from your documents to generate intelligent, grounded responses to your queries.

### What is Retrieval Engine?

[Retrieval Engine](https://ai.io.net/ai/re) stands for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** — a method of combining a language model with a retrieval system. Instead of relying solely on the language model's pre-trained knowledge, Retrieval Engine retrieves relevant context from your uploaded documents in real-time to answer your questions more accurately and specifically.

It’s especially useful in enterprise, research, and developer environments where accuracy, transparency, and traceability of answers are critical.

### Getting Started

To begin using the Retrieval Engine System:

1. **Go to your io.net Dashboard.**
2. Navigate to the [**Retrieval Engine**](https://ai.io.net/ai/re) into **IO Intelligence** section.
3. Upload your content and begin interacting with the system.

Main Settings

- **Vector Search** – Uses machine learning to find semantically similar content, even if exact keywords aren’t used.
- **Hybrid Search** – Combines both traditional keyword search and semantic (vector-based) search for more accurate results.
- **Graph Search** – Enhances retrieval using relationships and connections between documents or data points.

</Frame>

**Vector Search Settings**

- **Search Results Limit** – Number of results shown per query (default is 10).
- **Index Measure** – Method for comparing similarity:
  - **Cosine** – Measures angle between vectors (commonly used).
  - **Euclidean** – Measures straight-line distance.
  - **Dot Product** – Multiplies and sums vector elements.
- **Probes** – Controls the number of partitions searched; more probes = better recall, but slower performance.
- **EF Search** – Trade-off setting between speed and accuracy during search. Higher = better results but slower.

**Hybrid Search Settings**

- **Full Text Weight** – Sets how much importance to give exact keyword matches.
- **Semantic Weight** – Sets how much importance to give AI-based understanding of the text.
- **Full Text Limit** – Limits how many keyword-based results to include in hybrid search.
- **RRF K** – A ranking method that merges results from different search strategies. Higher K = more balanced merging.

**RAG Generation Settings (RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

- **Model** – Selects which AI model to use for generating responses.
- **Temperature** – Controls randomness of the AI’s responses:
  - Lower (e.g. 0.1) = more focused and deterministic answers.
- **Top P** – Controls diversity. 1 = full range of outputs considered.
- **Max Tokens to Sample** – Limits how long the AI’s response can be (1024 tokens = about 700–800 words).

title: "Clusters Page"
description: "The Clusters Page provides a public overview of all deployed clusters within the network, along with real-time metrics on active bookings. This feature helps users assess the current status of computational resources and understand the demand for decentralized compute power."

#### Key Metrics Displayed:

* **Total Compute Hours Served** (cumulative processing time delivered by the network)

### Daily Compute Hours

The Daily Compute Hours chart shows how many compute hours were contributed to the network each day.

* Hover on any bar to view the **exact number of compute hours** for that specific day.
* Monitor **daily trends in supply and usage** of GPU/CPU resources across the network.
* This visualization helps track fluctuations in **compute availability and demand** over time.

### List of Clusters

The Clusters Table provides a transparent, real-time view of all deployed clusters and their associated compute bookings.

**The table includes:**

* **Cluster Status** (active, idle, or under maintenance)
* **Cluster ID** (unique identifier for each cluster)
* **Remaining Compute Hours** (available processing capacity)
* **Device Types & Quantities** (hardware resources within each cluster)

This page enables users to **monitor compute resource availability**, track network performance, and optimize cluster utilization in real time.

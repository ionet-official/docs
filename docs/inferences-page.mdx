description: "The Inferences Page provides a public overview of all transactions conducted within the network, along with real-time metrics for these transactions."

### Key Metrics Displayed:

* **Total Inference Count** (cumulative number of inferences processed)
* **Total On-Chain Transactions** (total recorded transactions on the blockchain)
* **Today's Inference Count** (number of inferences processed within the last 24 hours)
* **Today's On-Chain Transactions** (transactions recorded on-chain today)

### List of Inferences

The Inferences Table offers a transparent, real-time view of transactions conducted on the network.

**The table includes:**

* **Transaction Status** (successful, pending, or failed)
* **Link to View Transaction Details**
* **Date** (when the inference was processed)
* **Time** (specific timestamp of execution)
* **Computed By** (identification of the computing resource used)

</Frame>

### Inference Details Page

Clicking on a transaction opens a **detailed view** with the following information:

* **Inference ID** (unique identifier for the transaction)
* **Status** (completed, pending, or failed)
* **Date** (when the inference was executed)
* **Computation Time** (duration in minutes/seconds)
* **Inference Micro Transaction URL** (on-chain transaction record)
* **Requested By App URL** (source application that initiated the request)

This page provides **full transparency** into how inferences are processed within the network, enabling users to track transaction history and ensure accuracy in AI computations.

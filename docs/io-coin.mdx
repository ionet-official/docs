---

IO Coin ($IO) is the native cryptocurrency of the IOG Network, powering its ecosystem and facilitating seamless interactions between key participants. These participants include:

### GPU Renters (Users):

Machine Learning Engineers, developers, and individual consumers who use \$IO to rent GPU computing power for tasks like deploying GPU clusters, running cloud gaming instances, or building applications such as Unreal Engine 5 pixel streaming. Users can also leverage \$IO for serverless AI model inferences via platforms like BC8.ai and other apps hosted on io.net.

### GPU Owners (Suppliers):

Independent data centers, crypto mining farms, and professional miners supply underutilized GPU computing power to the network. They earn \$IO tokens by providing this compute power.

### \$IO Coin Holders (Community):

Supporters who stake \$IO to secure the network, earn rewards and align incentives across the ecosystem for sustainable growth and adoption.

These roles are flexible—anyone can participate in multiple capacities (e.g., a GPU owner can also be an \$IO holder and a GPU renter).

### Universal Payment System

The IOG Network’s payment system revolves around \$IO. While users can pay in fiat (e.g., USD), USDC, or other supported cryptocurrencies, all payments are ultimately converted to \$IO behind the scenes. This approach reduces friction in transactions and avoids traditional issues like escrow and delayed billing, while maintaining strong demand for \$IO.

#### User Payments:

* Customers can pay in USDC or fiat for GPU services.
* Suppliers receive compensation in \$IO, creating demand for the token.

#### Supplier Options:

* Suppliers can opt to receive payments in native \$IO or convert earnings into USDC, based on their preference.

***

### Fee Structure: Incentivizing \$IO Use

The network’s fee model encourages the use of \$IO for transactions while charging minimal fees for critical operations like staking and rewards.

#### User Fees:

* Payments in USDC: 2% facilitation fee.
* Payments in \$IO: No fee.

#### Supplier Fees:

* Rewards earned through network emissions: No fee.

* Compute job earnings:

  * Payments in USDC: 2% fee.
  * Payments in \$IO: No fee.

This fee structure ensures that \$IO remains the most cost-effective way to transact on the network.

### Network Security and Collateralization

$IO is integral to securing and maintaining the network’s integrity. Two primary mechanisms achieve this:

#### Node Collateral Requirements:

A minimum amount of \$IO must be staked to operate a node and earn idle rewards.

#### Staking for Rewards:

Additional \$IO can be staked up to a maximum limit per node, allowing holders to earn rewards while contributing to the network’s security and reliability.

These mechanisms incentivize active participation and align interests across the network.

### Why \$IO Matters

$IO is more than just a transactional token—it’s the backbone of the IOG Network, driving economic activity and ensuring network health. Its design creates a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem that benefits Renters, Suppliers, and Holders alike.

By reducing payment friction, offering a flexible fee structure, and integrating network security features, \$IO builds a sustainable framework for growth and innovation.

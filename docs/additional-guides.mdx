Expose the ports below to ensure platform stability for Linux:

* TCP: 443, 25061, 5432, 80
* UDP: 80, 443, 41641, 3478

Ensure that these ports are open and accessible to enable smooth operation of the platform.

### How can I verify that program has started successfully?

* When running the following command on Terminal, **you should always have 2 Docker containers running**:
  <CodeGroup>
    ```Text Terminal Command
     docker ps
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

  * Restart the platform using the command from the website again.

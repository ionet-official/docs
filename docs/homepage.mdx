**Ready-to-Use Devices Secured with \$IO Staking** Each device in the network is pre-configured and secured by a stake in \$IO, proportional to its computational capacity. This ensures security, reliability, and efficient resource allocation.

**Total Cluster Readiness & Fully Collateralized GPUs/CPUs** This section displays the number of available GPUs and CPUs in the network, including both hired and idle devices. Only Cluster-Ready Devices - those that have successfully passed Proof of Work and are ready for deployment - are included.

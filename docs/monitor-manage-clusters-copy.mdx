| All Workers  | Allows you to filter the view by selecting different groups of workers. This option is currently set to show all workers in the cluster.                                                                 |
| /[#] Workers | Indicates that the dashboard currently shows four workers in the cluster that are active or relevant to the task being monitored. The panel below labels these workers as "IO Worker 1," "IO Worker 2," and so on. |
| /[#] GPUs    | Shows that there are 4 GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) in use across the cluster. Each worker seems to have one GPU assigned to it, as indicated by the details in each worker's panel.                   |
| Search       | The search bar allows you to quickly find specific workers, GPUs, or tasks by searching based on keywords, worker names, device IDs, or other identifiers.                                                 |

## Detailed information for each worker:

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decentralized Network          | IO Cloud uses a network of computers (called "IO workers") to create powerful GPU clusters. This means you're not relying on a single company for your computing power. |
| Self-healing                   | If one part of the cluster has issues, the others automatically take over, keeping your projects running smoothly. |
| Easy to Use                    | You can easily run your AI projects using Python code, just like on any other cloud platform.                      |
| Built on Industry-leading Technology | IO Cloud is powered by the same technology used by OpenAI to train its powerful AI models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. |

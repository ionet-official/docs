description: "Introducing TNE On Chain — io.net’s next-generation transaction system built on Solana blockchain."
---

TNE On Chain marks a major milestone in io.net’s evolution, introducing a fully transparent and verifiable transaction system on the Solana blockchain. This upgrade brings every booking, payment, and \$IO repurchase on-chain — making io.net one of the first AI compute networks to offer complete financial transparency and security for its users and suppliers.

By recording all financial activity on-chain, TNE introduces an immutable ledger of interactions between customers, suppliers, and io.net’s treasury. This system not only enforces accountability, but also improves automation, strengthens trust, and aligns the platform with Web3-native infrastructure.

## Why On-Chain?

Moving transactions to the Solana blockchain ensures:

* **Transparency** — Every payment, refund, or repurchase can be independently verified.
* **Security** — Funds are held in escrow using smart contracts, reducing risk.
* **Efficiency** — Automated payments and settlements minimize delays and errors.
* **Decentralization** — All financial flows are publicly auditable and blockchain-native.
* **Ecosystem Support** — A portion of every transaction goes toward repurchasing \$IO on the open market, supporting liquidity and value for token holders.

Total Network Earnings and Daily Network Earnings reflect estimated values based on compute provided, not actual payments or finalized settlements.

## How It Works

The **Transactions** tab gives users full visibility into the financial activity happening across the io.net network. This section of the Explorer is designed to highlight revenue trends, individual transaction details, and the overall performance of the platform in real time..

From this dashboard, users can view:

### Total Network Earnings

This block provides a comprehensive overview of all revenue generated across the network. It includes:

* **Total Earnings Graph:** A line graph displaying estimated cumulative revenue over time.
* **Daily Change (%):** A quick view of the day-over-day percentage change in revenue, giving users an immediate sense of growth or fluctuation.
* **Detailed Revenue Graph:** A more granular visualization that breaks down network earnings into smaller time intervals or sources for deeper analysis.

### Daily Earnings Trends

This section highlights how earnings change over time, using a **Bar Chart by Day** to show daily revenue. It helps users spot trends, seasonal patterns, and the effects of key events or cluster deployments.

### Transaction List

This section provides a transparent view of all on-chain activities happening within the network. Users can track key transaction types - such as bookings, payments, refunds, and \$IO repurchases — with full visibility into each action’s status, amount, and associated cluster. Each transaction includes a direct link for verification on Solana Scan.:

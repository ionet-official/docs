When participating in \$IO staking, it’s crucial to only interact with the official and correct smart contract. This contract governs the staking process, ensuring your funds are safely managed in line with the platform's operations. To protect yourself from potential risks, always verify the contract address before making any transactions. Here’s how you can safeguard your funds and ensure the legitimacy of your transactions.

Be cautious of scammers who may ask you to transfer funds to alternative addresses. If you receive any unsolicited messages asking you to send crypto to another wallet or join a staking offer outside of official channels, **do not engage**. Scammers often impersonate our team, and many users have fallen victim to these attacks, resulting in lost funds. Protect your assets by following the steps outlined below.

## Security Practices to Protect Your Stake:

* **Access URLs Directly:** Always type **io.net** directly into your browser and bookmark the site. This protects against phishing sites that could trick you into entering personal details on fraudulent websites.
* **Verify Smart Contracts:** Before interacting with any smart contract, use trusted tools like **Solscan** to confirm the contract address matches the one provided in our official documentation. This step helps ensure your interactions are with legitimate addresses only.
* **Watch Out for Phishing:** Be cautious of links from unverified sources, unsolicited crypto offers, or direct messages, especially on platforms like Discord, social media, or community forums. Scammers often impersonate official channels and offer fake staking opportunities or ask you to send funds to alternative wallet addresses.
* **Use Secure Wallets:** For added security, use **hardware wallets** to store your funds. These provide an extra layer of protection against hacks. Never share your **private keys** or **seed phrases** with anyone, and always store them securely.

## Why this matters:

Interacting with **incorrect or malicious contracts** could result in the **loss of your funds** or the compromise of your sensitive information. Always verify every detail and follow the security measures listed above before making any transactions or interacting with smart contracts.

## Verify Official Contract Addresses

To ensure the security of your transactions with the \$IO ecosystem, always double-check the following contract addresses:

* **`$IO` Token Contract**: The official smart contract for the `$IO` token.
* **`$IO` Staking Contract**: The official contract for staking your `$IO` tokens.
* **`$IO` Safety Module**: The contract for the \$IO Safety Module, which provides additional security features for your stake.

You can verify these addresses using:

* **Official documentation** or the **io.net** website.
* **Blockchain explorers** like **Solscan**.
* **Community announcements** or official support channels.

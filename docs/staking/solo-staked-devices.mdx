## How to Stake

#### Connect Your Crypto Wallet

To stake on IO, you need to connect your crypto wallet.

1. Go to io.net \> **IO Worker** \> **Staking** tab.
2. Follow the steps in [Rewards and Wallets](/docs/rewards-wallets) to connect your wallet.

<Info>
  Staking above the minimum required stake does not increase block rewards.
</Info>

#### Stake \$IO

Once you’ve connected your wallet, you can stake \$IO to your device. After you connect your device to our network, you must stake to the device.

To view your devices that have no stake or only a stake from the device owner, click the **Solo Staked Devices** tab. The screenshot below shows a **list of devices**, indicating whether they have no stake, or just the owner’s stake.

2. In the pop-up window, enter the required **\$IO amount** to stake your device, then click **Stake**. Any subsequent solo staking attempts on the same worker must use the wallet that was initially used for the device’s stake.

## 14-Day Cooldown Period

The **14-day cooldown period** is important when unstaking your funds. Here's how it works:

- You can **unstake** at any time, but there is a **14-day cooldown period** before the funds can be fully withdrawn.
- **Funds in cooldown** are **not counted toward staking requirements.**
- During the cooldown, your funds remain locked and cannot be withdrawn until the process is complete.

<Danger>
  During the cooldown period, your funds do not contribute to staking rewards. You will only be able to access your funds after the 14-day period ends.
</Danger>

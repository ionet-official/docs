### Deleting a Co-Staking Offer

* If you unstake part of your contribution while co-staked, you are **not** subject to a cooldown period.
* If a co-staker cancels their stake, you have **7 days** to cover the remaining portion or create a new co-staking offer.
* During this **7-day period**, your device continues fulfilling staking requirements for block reward eligibility.

<Info>
Your device must still meet all other criteria.
</Info>

**Steps to Delete a Co-Staking Offer**:

1. Go to the **Manage Your Stake & Devices** block, where all your staking devices are listed, and click the three dots next to the desired device.

2. Select **Delete a Co-Staking Offer** from the dropdown list.

**If you unstake first:**

* If your stake remains above the minimum requirement, there is no impact.
* If your stake **falls below the requirement**, the system automatically unstakes for the co-staker. In this case, all funds enter the **14-day cooldown period**.

### Unstaking

You can cancel a stake at any time.

* **Unstaking takes 14 days.**
* You must **unstake the entire amount**, which stops counting toward the **Minimum Required Stake** immediately.
* You **cannot** restake until the process is complete.
* Unstaking **is not available** for devices in **hired status.**

**How to Unstake Your Device:**

1. Go to the **Manage Your Stake & Devices** block, where all your staking devices are listed, and click the three dots next to the desired device.

2. Select **Unstake** from the dropdown list.

**How to Withdraw Overflow:**

1. Go to the **Manage Your Stake & Devices** section and select the **Co-Staked Devices** tab.

2. Find your device, click the ellipsis, and select **Withdraw Overflow** from the dropdown menu.

A Mega-Ray Cluster is a cluster of machines managed by the Ray framework. You can select all available GPUs or CPUs under certain filters and hire them.

## Payments

IO Cloud customers can load their io.net account prior to deploying clusters, or they can pay at the end of the deploy process. The main two ways to pay for clusters is using Solana and credit cards. To use Solana, you must set up a wallet. This can be done when you register your account or later in **Account Settings**.

To learn more about the types of payments we offer and step-by-step guides, see [IO Cloud Payments](/docs/io-cloud-payments).

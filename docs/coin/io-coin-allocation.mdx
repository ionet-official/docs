title: "IO Coin Allocation"

### Initial \$IO Allocation

The genesis supply of \$IO is set at 500,000,000 tokens, distributed across five categories:

- Seed Investors
- Series A Investors
- Core Contributors
- Research & Development
- Ecosystem and Community

Over the next 20 years, this supply will grow to 800,000,000 \$IO through emissions designed to incentivize network growth and adoption.

### Unlocks and Rewards

The initial 500 million tokens are subject to specific unlock schedules outlined below. In addition, the circulating supply increases as rewards are issued. Rewards are unlocked upon receipt and immediately added to the circulating supply.

#### Key Definitions:

- Circulating Supply: The amount of \$IO available in general circulation without on-chain transfer restrictions.
- Locked Supply: The portion of \$IO that is unvested and unavailable for circulation.
- Available Supply: The sum of circulating supply and issued (but locked) tokens. Rewards not yet issued are excluded from this figure.
- Max Supply: The total number of \$IO tokens that will exist after all emissions have been completed.

A breakdown of these supply categories and schedules is provided in the chart below:

### Pro Forma Allocation

As the IOG Network emits rewards over time, the proportional share held by early backers and Core Contributors will gradually decrease. Consequently, the Communityâ€™s allocation will expand, reaching approximately 50% of the total supply once all rewards have been distributed.

## Adding a Wallet for Crypto Payments

If you plan to pay using crypto, you must add a wallet to your account. **Credit card users don't need to complete this step.**

## Adding Multiple Wallets

The **multi-wallet feature** allows you to add up to **10 Solana wallets** to your IO.net account, providing flexibility in managing **rewards, payments, and assets.**

This is particularly useful if one of your wallets becomes **inaccessible, lost, or compromised**, ensuring you still receive your rewards. Additionally, you can distribute rewards across different wallets for better **organization and security.**

You can add up to 10 wallets to your account. Here’s how to add additional wallets:

1. Underneath your first wallet address, find and click the **Add New Solana Wallet Address link**.

       alt=""
       className="mx-auto"
       style={{ width:"85%" }}
     />
   </Frame>
2. In the appearing popup, enter your new **Solana wallet address** just like you did for your first wallet.

       style={{ width:"83%" }}
     />
   </Frame>

## Primary Wallet Address

By default, your first wallet becomes the primary one. However, if you add more than one wallet, you can set another wallet as the primary. The primary wallet will be used for Block Rewards and payment transactions instead of the old address.

To change your primary wallet, hover your mouse over the desired wallet address and click on the blue star beneath the field. The selected wallet will then become the primary one.

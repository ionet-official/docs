**VM on Demand** - the easiest way to spin up fully-equipped virtual machines tailored for AI and ML workloads. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or solo builder, you can now launch GPU or CPU-powered VMs with pre-installed frameworks like PyTorch, and CUDA - no DevOps required.

With just a few clicks, you'll go from zero to a ready-to-code environment, without the usual cloud complexity. Here's how to get started:

## Configure Your Cluster

### 1. Create Your Cluster

Start by selecting Virtual Machine from the cluster creation menu. This is your entry point to a customizable and dedicated compute environment.

  style={{ width:"47%" }}
/>

### 2. Select a Connectivity Tier

Your data transfer needs matter. Choose the right network bandwidth:

- **Ultra High Speed** - Perfect for model training, large datasets
- **High Speed** - Great for collaboration, notebooks, APIs
- **Medium Speed** - Works well for typical AI/ML dev cycles
- **Low Speed** - Best for testing, learning, or budget-focused work

  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"84%" }}
/>

### 3. Processor \+ Data Center Location

Pick the physical location where your VM will live. Closer regions = lower latency.

1. Choose a **Processor Type** (e.g., A100, EPYC)
2. Then, select your preferred **Location** from the available regions (e.g., US-East, EU-West, Asia-Pacific)

Deploying closer to your users or team means faster response times.

/>

### 4. Select Image & Add SSH Keys

Choose Your VM Image:

#### **‚Äî General Purpose Image**

> Ubuntu 24.04 64-bit, 3.5GB ‚Äì includes CUDA Toolkit and drivers. Ideal for running your own stack from scratch.

#### **‚Äî Data Science Image** (Coming Soon)

> The Data Science Image comes preloaded with a powerful GPU-accelerated environment for AI, machine learning, and analytics tasks. It includes:
>
> - **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
> - **Python**: 3.12
> - **Conda:** 25.7.0
> - **CUDA**: 12.1
> - **RAPIDS:** 25.6.0
>
> **This image is ideal for:**
>
> - Building and training machine learning models
> - Exploring large datasets with GPU acceleration
> - Running distributed computing tasks using Ray
> - Developing and testing AI workflows in Jupyter
>

> üöß **Important:** Using Environment Variables in Entrypoints
>
> To avoid deployment failures:
>
> - **Always define environment variables** in the `env_variables` section instead of substituting them directly in the `entrypoint` or `args`.
> - If you reference variables in the entrypoint, **`escape $ as $$`** so the container interprets them correctly.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```json
> "entrypoint": [
>   "sh", "-c", "echo 'Variable value: $${TEST_VAR}' && sleep 3600"
> ],
> "env_variables": {
>   "TEST_VAR": "This is a test"
> }
> ```
>
> - Correct: `$${TEST_VAR}` inside the container prints the variable value.
> - Incorrect: `$TEST_VAR` may fail during deployment.
> - Avoid passing variables via `args` or directly in the command; use `env_variables` instead.

> üöß Note for advanced users:
>
> There is a known issue where Terraform variable interpolation (`$`) can clash with environment variable substitution at the service layer. Escaping with `$$` prevents this conflict.

#### Add Your SSH Key:

Choose one of two ways to securely access your VM:

- **Manual Input**\
  Add a **key name** and your public **SSH key**.

    alt="Containers7 Jp"
    title="Containers7 Jp"
    className="mx-auto"
    style={{ width:"83%" }}
  />
- **Fetch from GitHub**  

  Just enter your **GitHub ID** - we‚Äôll pull your public key for you.

    title="Containers4 Jp"
    className="mx-auto"
    style={{ width:"67%" }}
  />

### 5. Add Network Services (Optional)

SSH is added by default. Want to expose other ports or services, here is how:

1. Click ‚Äú**Add First Network Service**‚Äù, and enter: Name, Port, Protocol (TCP/UDP), Whitelist IPs (who‚Äôs allowed in)
2. Click "**Plus**" button to apply. This gives you 
3. control over custom APIs, inference endpoints, or webhooks.

  alt="Containers5 Jp"
  title="Containers5 Jp"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"68%" }}
/>

#### Port Exposure on io.net

When deploying containers, users need to expose ports in two places:

1. **Docker inside the VM**\
   Specify the ports to expose when running the container:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 8082:8082 your-image-name
   ```
2. **io.net Network / Frontend Configuration**\
   After VM deployment, the platform will provide external ports that map to your container ports. Users need to use these ports to access the services externally.

> üìò **Note:**
>
> Local Docker port configuration is not automatically propagated to the external network. Both steps are necessary to make your services accessible from outside the VM.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**
>
> Network services (including port exposure) cannot be modified after the cluster is created.\
> Make sure to specify all required ports during cluster creation in the frontend, and also expose them in your Docker run command inside the VM.

### 6. Review Summary & Deploy

In the final screen, double-check and customize:

- Container Count
- GPU/CPU Quantity
- \*\*Runtime Duration \*\*- hourly, daily, or weekly (in hours)
- \*\*Payment Method \*\*- select your preferred option from **IO Coin**, **USDC**, **USD**

At the bottom, you‚Äôll see your total estimated cost. When ready, click Deploy VM button - your VM will now begin provisioning.

/>

## View Your Cluster

Once payment is processed and deployment finishes, you‚Äôll see a live view of your VM cluster.

Click **Return to Clusters** to monitor usage, pause or resume machines, or launch another VM.

Each cluster detail page gives you:

- Real-time resource usage
- SSH connection info
- Lifecycle controls (pause/resume/terminate)
- Billing insights

### To start working with your VM:

1. Find the SSH Access line on your VM Cluster page and **copy it**.

     alt="Containers9 Jp"
     title="Containers9 Jp"
     className="mx-auto"
     style={{ width:"72%" }}
   />
2. Open your Terminal and **paste the SSH command**, then **press Enter**.
3. You‚Äôll be asked to confirm the connection - **type yes** and **press Enter**.

     style={{ width:"74%" }}
   />
4. Once connected, you‚Äôll see the welcome message and be ready to use your VM through the SSH terminal.

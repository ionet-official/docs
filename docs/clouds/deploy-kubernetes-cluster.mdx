Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It abstracts away infrastructure complexity so you can focus on building and running applications efficiently across distributed environments.

## Kubernetes for GPU Workloads and Machine Learning

#### Kubernetes is particularly effective for machine learning (ML) and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, where GPU acceleration is critical. It offers:

- Dynamic GPU resource allocation for efficient workload distribution.
- Auto-scaling to optimize GPU utilization based on demand.
- Containerized ML environments for reproducibility and modularity.
- Resource isolation to prevent contention between workloads.

This guide outlines connecting to and interacting with a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` to manage GPU-accelerated workloads.

## To deploy a Kubernetes Service:

This guide walks you through creating and managing a Kubernetes cluster on the platform. Each step is designed to help you configure the environment according to your needs - whether for development, training, or production workloads.

### 1. Create Your Cluster

From the cluster creation menu, choose Kubernetes. This will launch the setup wizard for your dedicated compute environment.

### 2. Select Processor

Decide which hardware will power your cluster:

- Search among supported **CPUs/GPUs**.
- Pick your preferred **supplier**.
- Set the **number of processors** based on your workload requirements.

/>

### 3. Choose Location

Pick the region where your cluster will run.

- Locations depend on aggregated node availability.
- You can also search for a specific location if needed.

/>

### 4. Review & Deploy

On the summary screen, confirm your configuration:

- **Number of Nodes**  â€“ how many machines will be part of your cluster. More nodes increase scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Number of GPU/CPU per Node** â€“ the hardware resources allocated to each node. This defines the processing power available for your workloads.
- **Runtime Duration**  - hourly, daily, or weekly (in hours)
- **Payment Method** - choose from **IO Coin**, **USDC**, **USD** or **IO Credits**
- **Master Node Configuration** - define the resources for your master node, including **GPU** (if required), number of CPUs, memory allocation, and any additional configuration settings.

At the bottom, youâ€™ll see an **estimated total cost.** When ready, click **Deploy** to provision your Kubernetes cluster.

### View and Manage Your Cluster

After payment and provisioning, your cluster becomes available in the dashboard.

From the **Cluster Details** page, you can:

- Monitor **real-time resource usage**
- Access **SSH connection details**
- Control lifecycle â€“ **pause, resume, or terminate**
- Review **billing and usage insights**

Use **Return to Clusters** to see all active clusters or start a new deployment.

## Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster

To interact with your cluster, you'll need `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line tool. Ensure you have valid cluster credentials, which are typically provided as a `kubeconfig` file.

### Configuring `kubeconfig`

Your `kubeconfig` file contains authentication details and configuration settings for cluster access. You can set it up in two ways:

1. Using the export command:\
   `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig`
2. Moving it to the default location\
   `mv /path/to/your/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config`

Once set up, your system will automatically detect the configuration file.

**Verifying Cluster Access**

After configuring kubeconfig, verify connectivity with the cluster:

`kubectl cluster-info`\
`kubectl version`

These commands show cluster details and verify the compatibility between the client and server versions.

### Essential `kubectl` Commands

Once connected, utilize `kubectl` to manage and monitor your workloads efficiently.

**Retrieve Cluster Namespaces**

`kubectl get ns`

**List All Pods Across Namespaces**

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`

**View Deployments in a Specific Namespace**

`kubectl get deployments --namespace <namespace-name>`

**Describe a Deployment**

`kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> --namespace <namespace-name>`

**View Pod Logs**

`kubectl logs -l <label-key>=<label-value>`

These commands offer insights into cluster status, workloads, and logging, which are essential for debugging and performance tuning.

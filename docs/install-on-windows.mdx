### 7. Download and Launch IO Binary

**IO Binary** is a compiled executable file used to perform computational tasks and manage system operations. It is crucial for the operation of the platform as it handles essential functions directly related to the performance and reliability of computational resources.

<Warning>

Do not modify or run code directly in io.net’s docker containers. This may disqualify your device from earning block rewards or being hired. If you have suggestions or ideas for custom code in our Docker containers, contact customer support to suggest them.
</Warning>

In this step, what you are required to do is:

1. **Download the Executable File:** Copy the URL below, open your browser, and paste it. The browser downloads the executable file to your computer. **It's recommended to download the IO Binary again, as we often update versions for improvements.**

   ```
   https://github.com/ionet-official/io_launch_binaries/raw/main/io_net_launch_binary_windows.exe
   ```

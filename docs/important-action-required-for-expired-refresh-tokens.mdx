title: "Action Required for Expired Refresh Tokens"
description: "May 2025"
---

We’ve identified that some suppliers who generated their refresh tokens before we switched to non-expiring tokens may encounter token expiration after 365 days. This can lead to worker downtime and authentication errors such as:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {"error":"invalid_grant", "error_description":"Unknown or invalid refresh token."}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Error:** *Authentication failed. Your token might be invalid or expired. Please re-generate one and try again. Use `--no_cache=true` flag to re-authenticate.*

To resolve this, please follow these steps to generate a new **non-expiring** refresh token and restart your worker:

**Step 1:** Run the `io.net worker` CLI binary with the `--no_cache=true` flag to initiate token regeneration.

**Step 2:** Provide any required details to the CLI. Once successful, your worker will launch using the refreshed token.

<Info >
After completing the initial interactive authentication, you’ll see a new --token value. You can reuse this token to update other devices silently.

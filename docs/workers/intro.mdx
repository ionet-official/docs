### What is IO Worker?

IO Worker is like having a virtual rental manager for your device. It's a simple web app that lets you lend your computing power to those tackling AI tasks, making it easier for everyone to access the resources they need.

Thanks to our decentralized setup and smart resource management, you can earn more by renting out your GPU/CPU than you would with traditional cloud services. It's a win-win situation where you support others while boosting your own earnings.

With io.net, you're not just renting out hardware; you're part of a community that values collaboration and efficiency. Whether you're a business looking to optimize resources or an individual keen on making extra profits, io.net has got you covered.

### Key Features

* **Decentralized Compute Power:** IO Workers enable access to a distributed network of GPUs and CPUs, providing the computational resources users need.
* **Cost-Efficiency:** By leveraging IO Workers, users can benefit from cost-effective compute resources. The decentralized nature of the network optimizes costs, reduces latency, and provides scalable compute capabilities.
* **Scalability:** IO Workers offer flexibility, allowing users to scale their computational resources based on demand. This ensures efficient handling of varying workloads.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Users can monitor the performance of IO Workers in real-time, tracking metrics such as uptime, resource utilization, and job completion rates for efficient management and optimization.
* **Secure Resource Sharing:** IO Workers facilitate secure resource sharing among network participants. Users maintain control over access and usage while sharing their compute resources securely.
* **Global Accessibility:** IO Workers provide global accessibility, allowing users from different regions and industries to access and utilize decentralized compute power seamlessly.

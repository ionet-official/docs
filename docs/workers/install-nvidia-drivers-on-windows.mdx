### What are Nvidia Drivers?

NVIDIA drivers are software packages that allow your computer's operating system to communicate effectively with NVIDIA graphics cards. These drivers ensure that your GPU can perform optimally, providing support for various features such as graphical rendering, video playback, and gaming performance. Keeping your NVIDIA drivers up to date is important for maintaining system stability, compatibility with new software, and obtaining the best performance from your graphics card.

To check that you have the correct drivers, open a command line on your Windows PC (Windows key + R, type cmd) and type into it the following.

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text Terminal Command
  nvidia-smi
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you encounter the following error message:

```
C://Users>nvidia-smi  
'nvidia-smi' is not recognized as an internal or external command,  
operable program or batch file.
```

It means that you do not have NVIDIA drivers installed. To install them, follow the steps below:

### 3. Go to [Nvidia Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) Download Page

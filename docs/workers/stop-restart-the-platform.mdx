title: "Stop & Restart the Platform"
---

### Stop the Platform

Run the command below in Terminal to stop and remove all containers for Linux.

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text Terminal Command
  sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -a -q); sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -q)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Restart the Platform

* Reboot your computer or server.
* After you reboot the device, restart the platform.
* Rerun the same command provided on the website during the initial setup. It resembles `docker run -d`.

<Danger>
Verify that you're not running two instances of io-worker-vc.
</Danger>

Run the command below to verify that you're running a single instance of io-worker-vc.

<CodeGroup>
  ```Text Terminal Command
  docker ps
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If there are 2 containers running the same image io-worker-vc , the platform fails. The output resembles the sample below:

```
~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                               COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
87b1b066bdfa   ionetcontainers/io-worker-monitor   "tail -f /dev/null"      3 seconds ago    Up 2 seconds             agitated_hawking
7033c1b8feba   ionetcontainers/io-worker-vc        "sudo -E /srp/invoke…"   8 seconds ago    Up 8 seconds             friendly_ritchie
67f699e12c2e   ionetcontainers/io-worker-vc        "sudo -E /srp/invoke…"   10 seconds ago   Up 8 seconds             sleepy_feynman
```

#### How to fix this?

Run the stop all docker containers (check troubleshooting guide) and run the (docker run -d ...) command from website only ONCE to run the platform normally.

## What is a Solana Wallet?

A Solana wallet is a digital wallet used to store, manage, and interact with Solana (SOL) tokens and other assets on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to securely send, receive, and store their SOL tokens, as well as participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities such as staking, lending, and trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Solana wallets come in various forms, including web wallets, mobile wallets, desktop wallets, and hardware wallets, each offering different levels of security and convenience for managing SOL tokens and engaging with the Solana ecosystem.

## How to Create a Solana Wallet

IO.NET is a DeFi project on Solana that pools GPU/CPU resources for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) companies. It uses Solana's blockchain for transparent proof-of-compute, making all jobs and transactions visible on-chain. You can create any Solana (SOL) wallet from the official list here: [Solana Ecosystem](https://solana.com/en/ecosystem/explore?categories=wallet).

For this example, we will use a popular option - Phantom, and demonstrate how to configure and use the wallet:

#### 1. Go to [Phantom Wallet.](https://phantom.app/)

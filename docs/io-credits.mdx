### What Are IO Credits?

**IO Credits** are prepaid credits you can use to pay for compute deployments on IO Cloud, including Ray Clusters, VMs, Kubernetes, and Baremetal. **Each IO Credit is equivalent to** 1 USD, making pricing simple and consistent.

#### Refunds as Credits

If a deployment ends early or is cancelled, any unused funds are returned as IO Credits. You'll be notified via the **Notification Center**.

## How to Use IO Credits

* `GET /credits/check?amount=XX`
* Pending Payment state
* Small negative credit allowance (e.g., -$10)
* 5-minute grace window with top-up prompt
* Failure if not topped up in time

* **Usage deductions** – credits spent on compute deployments or inference runs
* **Refunds** – returned credits from early terminations or unused deployments

Each entry includes **IO Service, Timestamp, Type of transaction, Amount added or deducted, Transaction ID**
